Epson WF-7820 Firmware Downgrade (CD08M4)
This repository provides a modified .dmg file to downgrade the firmware of the Epson WorkForce WF-7820 printer to version CD08M4. This older firmware version restores compatibility with third-party ink cartridges, which newer updates (e.g., CD30N1) often block.

Current as of March 21, 2025.

Purpose
Epson’s firmware updates can prevent the use of affordable third-party ink. This repo offers a pre-modified installer with the CD08M4 firmware extracted and bundled, making it easier for macOS users to revert their WF-7820 without manually extracting or modifying files.
